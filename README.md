This project focuses on predicting real estate values using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains various features affecting housing prices. The model is trained and tested using different machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate prediction.
üìä Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset contains the following key features:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable

NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940

DIS: Weighted distances to employment centers

TAX: Property tax rate

PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio

B: Proportion of Black residents

LSTAT: Percentage of lower status population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

üèóÔ∏è Model Implementation
The project explores multiple machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

The trained model is saved using joblib and can be loaded for future predictions.
